    <p>Today I will be sharing my passion about music. Music completely changed my life. Music is one of the powerful instrument of life
        It has the power to bring us joy, tears, and can carry us back in time and inspire us to dance in the moment.
        It speaks what we cannot expressed. Music soothes the mind and gives it rest, heals the heart and makes it whole flows from heaven to soul.
        Music really bring me peace and joy every time I play and listens to it. Music is also a strong symbol of life. When people are hurt and suffering music helps us,
        to makpe it feel all better. When I was a kid I used to ask myself, what i am capable of, I was very insecure to those people who are most talented and play every kind of instrument.
        Until I start to learn guitar, everything has changed. The people that I used to think that I'm insecure of them, they inspire me to become a good instrument player.
