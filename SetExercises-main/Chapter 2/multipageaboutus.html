<i><h2>Where music can be your therapist</h2></i>
<div#1><p>Music is a kind of art that combines vocal or instrumental sounds for aesthetic beauty or emotional expression, typically in accordance with cultural norms for harmony, melody, and rhythm. The simple folk song and the intricate electronic composition both fall within the umbrella of music. Both have been conceptually and acoustically constructed by humans, and both may be found in music of all genres and from all eras of history.</p></div>
<h3>What is a music therapy?</h3>
<div#2><p>Music therapy can be an active procedure in which patients participate in the creation of music or a passive one in which patients just listen to or react to music. Some therapists could employ a multifaceted strategy that combines active and passive musical encounters.</p></div>
